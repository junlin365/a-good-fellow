description: Set up or upgrade the good-fellow GitHub automation. Installs the skills for every agent on the machine, checks gh login, derives and creates the user's personal instruction gist when missing, verifies headless agent auth, publishes the runner, and installs a 30-minute cron job with low-cost periodic source/gist synchronization. Use when the user says onboard, /onboard, set up good-fellow, initialize the GitHub agent, or upgrade an existing installation.

# Onboard

Interactive bootstrap for good-fellow. Run each step in order, report progress as you
go, and finish with a summary of what was configured. This skill is the only
good-fellow skill allowed to prompt the user and to change machine state (symlinks,
generated scripts, crontab).

Read `docs/conventions.md` in this repo first. Resolve `<REPO_ROOT>` from this file's
real location (`SKILL.md` may be reached through a symlink — follow it). Everything
below must work for **any user on macOS or Linux**: derive paths from `$HOME`, never
assume a username, and prefer commands available in both GNU and BSD userlands.

## Step 0 — Tell the user what will be touched, then create the state directory

Onboarding writes **outside the repository**, and most agents restrict that: the
`Write`/`Edit` tools typically refuse absolute paths outside the working directory,
which mid-flow shows up as a blocked write and a permission dialog. Two rules avoid
that entirely:

- **Never use the `Write`/`Edit` tools for anything outside `<REPO_ROOT>`.** Create
  out-of-tree files with a single `Bash` heredoc instead (`cat > file <<'EOF'`).
  Bash is governed by command permissions rather than the workspace path check, so
  one approval covers the whole write.
- **Ask once, up front.** Before touching anything, list every out-of-tree path this
  skill will create or modify, so the user grants access knowingly instead of being
  interrupted later:

  | Path | Why |
  |---|---|
  | `~/.good-fellow/` | state: instruction cache, logs, worktrees, generated runner |
  | `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/`, `~/.cursor/skills/` | skill symlinks (only for agents that exist) |
  | the user's crontab | the 30-minute schedule |

  Mention that they can pre-authorize instead of approving each step — in Claude
  Code, starting the session with `claude --add-dir ~/.good-fellow` (after Step 0
  creates it) or approving the first Bash write covers the rest.

If a write is denied anyway, **do not stop and do not leave setup half-finished**:
print the exact command block for the user to paste into their own shell, ask them to
confirm when done, then verify the result yourself (`test -x`, `crontab -l`) and carry
on with the remaining steps.

Create the state directory now — this is also the first approval prompt, so say what
it is for:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.good-fellow/logs ~/.good-fellow/worktrees
```

## Step 1 — Install the skills for every agent on this machine

Detect installed agents by their home directories: `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`,
`~/.cursor` (ask the user about any other agent they use that reads SKILL.md
folders). For each detected agent, symlink every skill folder from this repo into its
skills directory. Rules:

- Create the `skills` directory if missing.
- If the target name is already a symlink, refresh it (`ln -sfn`; BSD `-n` behaves
  like `-h`, so this works on macOS too).
- If the target exists and is **not** a symlink, leave it alone and warn — never
  overwrite someone's real skill.

Example (adapt as needed):

```bash
for base in "$HOME/.claude" "$HOME/.codex" "$HOME/.cursor"; do
  [ -d "$base" ] || continue
  mkdir -p "$base/skills"
  for skill in <REPO_ROOT>/skills/*/; do
    name=$(basename "$skill")
    if [ -e "$base/skills/$name" ] && [ ! -L "$base/skills/$name" ]; then
      echo "SKIP: $base/skills/$name exists and is not a symlink"
    else
      ln -sfn "${skill%/}" "$base/skills/$name"
    fi
  done
done
```

## Step 2 — GitHub CLI login

Run `gh auth status`. If logged in, report the account and continue.

If not logged in, assume a remote/headless machine with no browser. Start the
device-code flow in the background so you can stream its output:

```bash
gh auth login --hostname github.com --git-protocol https --web
```

The command prints a one-time code (like `XXXX-XXXX`) and the URL
`https://github.com/login/device`, then waits. Relay both to the user verbatim and
tell them to open the URL on their own computer/phone and enter the code. Wait for
the command to complete, then re-run `gh auth status` to confirm. If the code
expires, restart the login and relay the fresh code.

## Step 3 — Personal instruction gist

(Once onboarding is done, the **sync-instructions** skill handles this file from then
on — pulling, editing, and pushing it back. The steps here are the first-time setup.)

Look for the gist:

```bash
gh api /gists --paginate --jq '.[] | select(.files["good-fellow-instruction.md"]) | .id' | head -1
```

- **Found**: download it to the cache and show the user a short summary of what it
  says:

  ```bash
  gh gist view <GIST_ID> --filename good-fellow-instruction.md > ~/.good-fellow/instruction.md
  ```

- **Not found**: create the first version automatically. Review only conversation
  history and persistent preferences the current agent is actually allowed to see.
  Summarize durable evidence about how the user prefers to collaborate and code,
  what they care about most, their review taste, and their standard for good code.
  Never invent preferences, infer sensitive traits, or mine unrelated GitHub content.
  If history is sparse, use a short conservative baseline: preserve compatibility,
  avoid unnecessary code/files, test behavior in proportion to risk, explain material
  tradeoffs, and match the user's language. Do not interrupt onboarding to ask them to
  dictate content.

  Write a concise Markdown file with sections for collaboration, engineering
  priorities, review standards, and repository-specific preferences when supported by
  evidence. Save it with a heredoc — **not the `Write` tool**, which would be blocked
  outside the repo (Step 0):

  ```bash
  cat > ~/.good-fellow/instruction.md <<'EOF'
  <evidence-backed summary, with conservative defaults where history is silent>
  EOF
  ```

  Upload it immediately as a secret gist so future machines can reuse it, then show
  the user the created content and gist URL so they can refine it later with
  `/sync-instructions`. The filename inside the gist must be exactly
  `good-fellow-instruction.md` (gist filenames come from the local file name, so
  create it from a copy with that name):

  ```bash
  cp ~/.good-fellow/instruction.md /tmp/good-fellow-instruction.md
  gh gist create /tmp/good-fellow-instruction.md --desc "good-fellow personal instructions"
  ```

After either path, record the exact last-synced content for conflict detection:

```bash
cp ~/.good-fellow/instruction.md ~/.good-fellow/instruction.remote
chmod 600 ~/.good-fellow/instruction.md ~/.good-fellow/instruction.remote
date +%s > ~/.good-fellow/maintenance-last-check
chmod 600 ~/.good-fellow/maintenance-last-check
```

### Existing-install upgrade mode

When the scheduled maintenance prompt says the source was fast-forwarded, run
unattended upgrade mode: preserve `instruction.md` and `instruction.remote`, refresh
the skill symlinks from Step 1, and publish/verify a new immutable deployment with
Step 5. Do not repeat login, gist authoring, or cron installation. If the checkout is
dirty/diverged or a prerequisite is unsafe, log the reason and leave the current
deployment active; never ask a question from the scheduled run.

## Step 4 — Headless agent auth

The scheduled job needs an agent CLI that runs without a human. Check, in order
(matching the runner's auto-detect):

1. `claude`: usable if `~/.good-fellow/env` defines `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, or
   `~/.claude/.credentials.json` exists.
2. `codex`: usable if `~/.codex/auth.json` exists.
3. `cursor-agent`: usable if installed and `cursor-agent status` shows a login.

If none is usable, ask the user to fix it and pause until they have. Have them run
these **themselves** rather than pasting the token to you — it is a long-lived
credential, and this keeps it out of the transcript:

```bash
claude setup-token
umask 077 && printf 'CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=%s\n' '<token>' >> ~/.good-fellow/env
```

Alternatively they can log in with codex or cursor-agent. Verify afterwards without
printing the secret (`test -s ~/.good-fellow/env`, `grep -c CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN
~/.good-fellow/env`). Do not install a scheduled job that can never run.

## Step 5 — Publish an immutable deployment

Cron invokes the stable launcher `~/.good-fellow/run-good-fellow.sh`. Each onboarding
creates a new versioned deployment containing both the runtime files and its matching
runner, validates everything, then atomically replaces a regular pointer file. The
launcher reads that pointer and `exec`s the paired runner. Never overwrite files in a
published deployment, and never truncate the live launcher.

Requirements the generated script must satisfy:

- **Portability**: runs on macOS's default bash 3.2 and BSD userland as well as
  Linux. No `flock` on macOS → fall back to an atomic `mkdir` lock. No GNU `timeout`
  on macOS → use `gtimeout` if present, else run without a hard limit.
- **Single instance, orphan-proof**: skip the tick if the previous run still holds
  the lock — but the lock design must make "stuck forever" impossible:
  - The runner **process itself** holds the lock. Never spawn a sentinel/background
    process to hold it: if that child leaks, every later tick sees "concurrent run"
    and silently skips for days (this happened in production).
  - Launch the agent child with the lock fd **closed** (`9>&-`) so no leaked
    subprocess can inherit it and keep the lock alive after the runner exits.
  - Record the holder PID and acquisition time. A contender that finds a lock older
    than ~2×MAX_RUNTIME (healthy runs are hard-capped at MAX_RUNTIME) must treat it
    as stuck: log loudly, kill the recorded holder, and reclaim — never skip.
  - Open the flock file with append (`9>>`), not truncate (`9>`): a truncating open
    happens even when the contender then fails to get the lock, which would reset
    the staleness clock on every tick.
  - Every skip logs the holder PID and lock age so repeated skips are diagnosable.
- **PATH**: cron strips the environment — rebuild a PATH covering `$HOME/.local/bin`,
  `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, and the system dirs.
- **Auth checks**: `gh auth status` must pass; agent CLI auto-detect in the order
  claude → codex → cursor-agent (overridable via `GOOD_FELLOW_AGENT`).
- **Workspace access**: the sweeps clone into `~/<repo>` and use
  `~/.good-fellow/worktrees/`, both outside the runner's working directory. Grant
  access explicitly (`claude --add-dir "$HOME"`), otherwise those writes are blocked
  with nobody present to approve them and the run fails silently.
- **Claude invocation**: do NOT use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` (claude refuses
  it when running as root); pre-authorize tools with `--allowedTools` instead.
- **Timeout**: default 1500s so a run always ends before the next 30-minute tick.
  Preserve older `1800`-second configurations by clamping any value at or above the
  cadence to 1799 with a warning instead of bricking every scheduled run. Clamp an
  oversized review floor to the resulting cleanup-safe maximum for the same reason.
- **Review priority and deadline**: run `process-prs` first, then the other owner
  sweeps, and run `reply-notifications` last so it can consume their receipts and
  clear only work they actually covered. Export absolute run and stop epochs, and
  reserve at least 120s for cleanup/reporting. Process PRs serially, applying the
  review-time floor only before each next deep item, and preserve HEAD/state handoff.
- **Immutable scheduled deployment**: copy `skills/`, `docs/`, and `AGENTS.md` into a
  versioned deployment alongside its matching runner. Publish only by atomically
  replacing `deployment-current`, a regular pointer file consumed by the stable
  launcher. A dirty/editing source checkout can never change a sweep mid-run.
- **Immutable skill resolution**: Claude must not receive its global `Skill` tool;
  the prompt requires direct reads from the deployment. Codex runs with a paired
  minimal `CODEX_HOME` whose `skills` points only at the deployment runtime (and whose
  auth file may point at the user's credential). Never let scheduled agents resolve
  the interactive skill symlinks in `~/.claude/skills` or `~/.codex/skills`.
- **Log rotation**: delete logs in `~/.good-fellow/logs` older than 14 days.
- **Deployment retention**: after a new pointer is published and verified, retain the
  three newest real `deploy-*` directories and remove older immutable deployments.
- **Token-free maintenance gate**: before invoking an agent, run the bundled
  `maintenance-check.sh`. It stays offline between checks (48 hours by default),
  compares gist content without model context, preserves local edits/conflicts, and
  fast-forwards only its private managed source under `~/.good-fellow/source` (never
  the user's checkout). Invoke upgrade mode in the already scheduled agent run only
  when source code actually changed. Override the cadence
  with `GOOD_FELLOW_SYNC_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (for example `4147200` for 48 days).

Materialize the deployment before writing its runner. Execute this publication flow
with `set -e`; any failed copy, comparison, executable check, syntax check, or rename
must abort before the pointer changes:

```bash
set -e

Read those exact deployment paths directly. Do not invoke a global slash command or

the files above are the immutable runtime selected for this sweep.

The hard deadline is epoch $GOOD_FELLOW_RUN_DEADLINE_EPOCH; stop new work at
$GOOD_FELLOW_RUN_STOP_AT_EPOCH. Do not begin a nontrivial PR review with fewer than
$GOOD_FELLOW_MIN_REVIEW_SECONDS seconds remaining. Prefer deferring over a shallow
review or a stale write. The final reply-notifications cleanup may use its explicit
cutoff near the hard deadline; it is reserved cleanup, not new owner work.

Process PRs one at a time. Before each next deep PR item, use the review-time floor:
continue when enough time remains, otherwise stop without bulk-skipping the queue tail.
Respect the persistent queue and resume only a valid HEAD/state-bound handoff.

Verify the launcher, pointer, and selected version runner before relying on them:
`bash -n ~/.good-fellow/run-good-fellow.sh`, `test -f
~/.good-fellow/deployment-current`, and `bash -n
"$(cat ~/.good-fellow/deployment-current)/run-good-fellow.sh"`.

## Step 6 — Scheduled job (every 30 minutes)

Use cron — it works on both Linux and macOS. Install idempotently: check
`crontab -l` for `run-good-fellow.sh` first; if present, report and skip.

Otherwise append, preserving existing entries and headers, with all paths under the
**current user's home** (run `echo $HOME` — never assume a username):

```
7,37 * * * * $HOME/.good-fellow/run-good-fellow.sh >> $HOME/.good-fellow/logs/cron-$(date +\%Y\%m\%d-\%H\%M).log 2>&1
```

(Write `$HOME` out as its literal value — cron does not reliably expand variables in
the command field on all systems.) Use minutes 7 and 37, off the hour, to avoid the
top-of-hour cron rush and other jobs on the machine. If the crontab lacks
`SHELL`/`PATH`/`HOME` headers entirely, add them using this machine's actual values
(`echo $PATH`, `echo $HOME`) so `gh` and the agent CLI resolve — on macOS that must
include the Homebrew bin dir (`/opt/homebrew/bin` on Apple Silicon, `/usr/local/bin`
on Intel).

Install it in one command so it is a single approval and never leaves the crontab
half-written (`crontab -` replaces the whole table, so always start from the current
one):

```bash
{ crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo '7,37 * * * * <expanded command line>'; } | crontab -
```

Verify with `crontab -l` after writing.

macOS note: the first cron run may be blocked until the user grants `cron` Full Disk
Access (System Settings → Privacy & Security). If the smoke test below works but
scheduled runs produce no logs, tell the user to check that setting.

## Step 7 — Smoke test and summary

Run the generated runner once by hand in dry-run mode to prove auth + locking +
logging work end to end:

```bash
SMOKE_OUTPUT=$(GOOD_FELLOW_DRY_RUN=1 ~/.good-fellow/run-good-fellow.sh 2>&1)
printf '%s\n' "$SMOKE_OUTPUT"
printf '%s\n' "$SMOKE_OUTPUT" | grep -Fx 'good-fellow dry run ok.' >/dev/null
printf '%s\n' "$SMOKE_OUTPUT" | grep -F 'done (status 0)' >/dev/null
```

A `previous run still going ... skipping this tick` line is **not** a smoke-test pass,
even though the lock path exits 0. Wait for that sweep to finish, then retry before
reporting onboarding complete.

Then report: agents the skills were installed for, gh account, gist status
(found/created + id), which agent CLI the runner will use, the cron schedule, and
where logs land (`~/.good-fellow/logs/`).

Finally, tell the user to **restart their agent session**: agents build their skill
list at startup, so the session that just ran onboarding (and any other session that
was already open) will not recognize `/onboard`, `/process-prs`, or the other slash
commands until it is restarted.
