# Agent guide

This repository is a set of agent-agnostic skills that handle GitHub PRs, issues,
notifications, and discussions on the user's behalf.

Before executing any skill here, read `docs/conventions.md` — it defines the
untrusted-input boundary, workspace isolation rules, the `<!-- good-fellow:v1 -->`
marker, and idempotence requirements. Also read `~/.good-fellow/instruction.md`
(the user's standing instructions, cached from their gist) and apply it to every
GitHub task.

Skills (each in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`):

- `onboard` — interactive setup: skill installation, gh login, instruction gist,
  headless auth, generated cron runner. Start here on a fresh machine.
- `reply-notifications` — final sweep: reply where warranted and reconcile routed
  notifications against owner-sweep receipts/current state.
- `join-discussions` — reply to Discussions that @mention the user.
- `fix-assigned-issues` — fix assigned issues and open PRs; request a concrete split
  for decomposable oversized work, or resume an atomic change from its bounded handoff.
- `create-pr` — commit + push + open a PR from a working tree with changes.
- `process-prs` — fix feedback on the user's PRs; review others' PRs (critical
  issues when found; otherwise a concise, concrete rationale, with bare `LGTM` only
  for extremely simple changes; fail closed on incomplete evidence or stale state,
  approve only when clean and review was requested, leave a visible HEAD-bound
  waiting outcome when external gates block approval, and persist fair round-robin
  progress plus HEAD/state-bound handoffs across bounded runs).
- `check-status` — read-only health check: is a sweep running, is cron firing, what
  did recent runs do, and what specifically to fix when they didn't.
- `sync-instructions` — pull the instruction gist to the local cache, or edit and
  push it back; diffs before overwriting either side.

Only `onboard` and `sync-instructions` change the user's instructions or machine
setup; `check-status` never changes anything without asking.

The scheduled entry point is `~/.good-fellow/run-good-fellow.sh` (cron, every 30
minutes) — a stable launcher that atomically selects a versioned runtime/runner pair
via `~/.good-fellow/deployment-current`. Before invoking a model, its deterministic
maintenance gate stays offline until the configured interval (48 hours by default),
then conflict-safely refreshes the instruction cache and cleanly fast-forwards a
private managed source without touching the user's checkout. Onboard generates these
machine-local files from `skills/onboard/SKILL.md`; they are not versioned here.
